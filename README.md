# Hesabpak (HP)

Monorepo for the Hesabpak accounting platform. The project currently contains:

- `backend/` — FastAPI service with PostgreSQL, Alembic migrations, and pytest suite.
- `frontend/` — React + Vite client (RTL, Jalali-aware UI).
- `infra/` — Deployment notes and docker-compose files.
- `docs/` — Architectural references and planning material.

## Getting Started

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Backend swagger UI (once running): `http://localhost:8000/docs`  
Frontend app: `http://localhost:3000`

For local development copy `backend/.env.example` → `backend/.env` and adjust secrets.

## Tooling

- Python: `pytest`, `black`, `isort` (managed via `pre-commit`).
- Node: `eslint`, `prettier`, `lint-staged` (configured in `frontend`).
- CI: GitHub Actions workflow under `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Optional 2FA (TOTP) for sign-in flows is available via `/api/auth/otp/*` endpoints.

### Developer Setup

```bash
# backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
pip install pre-commit black isort flake8
pre-commit install

# frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run prepare   # installs husky hooks
```
